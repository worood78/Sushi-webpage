      <p>
        Sushi is the first name that strikes us when Japanese cuisine is
        mentioned.<br />
        Sushi is perhaps the best known Japanese food dish to the outside
        world.<br />
        It is a recipe that consists of rice and fish with a flavor of
        vinegar.<br />
        However, there are many variations of Sushi that are lesser known by
        people outside Japan.
